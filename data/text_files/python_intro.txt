 The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and 
    the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and
    relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: 
    two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening 
    fixtures.

    The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of clubs from the First Division
    (the top tier since 1888) to break away from the English Football League. Teams are still promoted and relegated to and from the 
    EFL Championship each season. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs as shareholders.
    The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion domestic television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group broadcasting 128 and 32 games, 
    respectively.[4][5] This will rise to £6.7 billion from 2025 to 2029.[6] In the 2022–2025 cycle, the Premier League earned a record 
    £5.6 billion from international rights.[7] As of 2023–24, Premier League clubs received central payments totalling £2.8 billion, 
    with additional solidarity payments made to relegated EFL clubs.[8]
